# SOC 2 Readiness Assessment

> **Demo PDF:** [SOC2_Readiness_Demo.pdf](https://github.com/louis-cyber-security234/SOC-2-Readiness-Assessment/blob/main/SOC2_Readiness_Demo.pdf)

## Overview
A concise, auditor-friendly walkthrough assessing an AWS environment against SOC 2 control objectives. The demo intentionally shows common misconfigurations, enables logging and configuration monitoring, evaluates compliance with a conformance pack, remediates findings, and re-checks posture. No third-party scanners are used.

## What you will see in the demo
- Account-wide logging via CloudTrail and configuration monitoring via AWS Config
- SOC 2-aligned conformance pack evaluation
- Identification of high-risk issues (for example open SSH, public S3 without default encryption)
- Remediation, re-evaluation, and final all-green posture
- Evidence grouped for clients and auditors

## Business value delivered
- Strengthened security posture aligned to SOC 2
- Reduced audit readiness time and smoother audit cycles
- Clear remediation plan with evidence for each issue
- Client- and auditor-ready deliverable

## How this maps to SOC 2
- CC6 Access Controls - least privilege, secure network boundaries, S3 Public Access Block, default encryption
- CC7 Monitoring and Detection - CloudTrail and AWS Config for continuous visibility and drift detection
- CC8 Change Management - automated rules via conformance packs to surface misconfigurations
- CC3 and CC4 Risk Management - prioritised remediation with owners, due dates, and validation steps
- CC2 Documentation - packaged evidence and final compliance summary

## Repo contents
- Executive summary and conclusions suitable for stakeholders
- Step-by-step screenshots showing baseline, findings, fixes, and verification
- Remediation plan template and evidence index you can reuse in real engagements

## Who this is for
- Startups and small teams preparing for SOC 2
- Leaders who need a fast, visual path to audit readiness
- Engineers who want a minimal, native-AWS approach without extra tooling

## Notes
- This demo focuses on AWS native services: CloudTrail, AWS Config, and conformance packs
- No Amazon Inspector was used in this walkthrough
- Screens and names are illustrative and safe for sharing

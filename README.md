# SOC 2 Readiness & Compliance – Demo Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to prepare an AWS environment for **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria** by identifying misconfigurations, mapping them against SOC 2 requirements, and remediating them with AWS-native tools.  

The goal is to showcase **audit readiness** and provide a **clear remediation roadmap** for organisations aiming to pass SOC 2 Type 1 or Type 2 audits.

## 🎯 Objective
- Assess cloud environment against SOC 2 principles (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy).  
- Identify gaps and risks.  
- Provide evidence-backed remediation steps.  
- Deliver a client-ready report that accelerates SOC 2 audit success.  

## 💡 Why This Matters
SOC 2 is a **competitive differentiator**. Passing an audit builds trust, unlocks enterprise contracts, and reduces security risks.  
Failing an audit can cause **lost deals, reputational damage, and higher remediation costs**.

## ✅ Business Value
- Stronger security posture aligned with SOC 2.  
- Faster, smoother SOC 2 audit process.  
- Reduced audit readiness costs.  
- Increased client trust and credibility.  
- Improved governance and internal processes.  

## 🛠️ Approach
1. **Gap Assessment** – Review systems & configs for SOC 2-relevant risks.  
2. **Evidence Collection** – Screenshots, notes, and misconfigurations documented.  
3. **Mapping** – Align findings to SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria.  
4. **Remediation Plan** – Prioritised fixes with responsible owners.  
5. **Audit Evidence** – Prepared documentation for auditors.  

## 🚀 Key Outcomes
- Documented misconfigurations (e.g., open SSH ports, public S3 buckets).  
- Applied remediation (enabled MFA, encryption, logging).  
- Created CloudTrail and Config log storage for audit trails.  
- Deployed **SOC 2 Conformance Pack** for automated compliance checks.  
- Delivered a **board-ready report** with remediation evidence.  

## 📊 Tools & Services Used
- **AWS EC2** (security groups, SSH access).  
- **AWS S3** (bucket access, encryption).  
- **AWS CloudTrail** (audit logging).  
- **AWS Config** (compliance tracking).  
- **AWS Conformance Packs** (SOC 2 rules).  

## 📈 Strategic Alignment
- Prepares organisations for SOC 2 certification.  
- Enables enterprise deal qualification.  
- Reduces audit delays and failures.  
- Supports long-term governance and compliance maturity.  

## 🔮 Next Steps (For Clients)
1. Review SOC 2 readiness findings.  
2. Begin remediation plan with assigned owners.  
3. Validate fixes with compliance re-checks.  
4. Engage a SOC 2 auditor (Type 1 / Type 2).  
5. Establish **continuous compliance monitoring**.

### 📘 Summary
This demo provides a full **SOC 2 readiness playbook**:  
- **Simulate misconfigurations** → detect gaps.  
- **Apply remediations** → enforce SOC 2 criteria.  
- **Deploy automated checks** → maintain compliance.  

It serves as a repeatable, client-facing **SOC 2 Readiness Assessment** that reduces risk and accelerates audit timelines.
